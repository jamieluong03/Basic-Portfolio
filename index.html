        Hello! I am a UCLA Coding Bootcamp student looking for a career change. I graduated from Franklin & Marshall College with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Biochemistry in May, 2016.
        With my biochemistry background and my previous interest in dentistry, I have gained a variety of life and dental experiences that helped me grow as the person I am today.
        Outside of classes, I have been studying abroad in foreign countries and volunteering my time by giving back to those communities. Some of my volunteer experiences included
        dental assisting a dentist in Honduras, making kimchi for the low-income families in Korea, and traveling throughout Montana with AmeriCorps providing preventive dental care for school-aged kids.   
    </p>

    <p id="p1">
        My coding background is little to none. The only coding I remember ever using is for Myspace, calculus, and biostatistics. Therefore, I am somewhat familiar with HTML. I've used MatLab for calculus and R for biostatistics.
        After realizing that dentistry might not be for me right now, I hope to utilize this course as a stepping stone and hope to add these new skills that could potentially help me pursue
        something related to biochemistry. Thanks for reading!
    </p>
